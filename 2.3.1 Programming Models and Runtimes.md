### 2.3.1 Programming Models and Runtimes

#### 2.3.1.02 STPM02-LANL ATDM PMR Projects
2.3.1.02 STPM02-LANL ATDM PMR: The LANL ATDM PMR project made significant progress in integration of Legion Dynamic Control Replication and Dependent Partitioning features within the FleCSI framework. This will enable improved scalability of FleCSI applications while providing improved productivity for developers. Dependent Partitioning in FleCSI will enable new use cases in the future such as adaptive mesh and other dynamic data structures that adapt during application runtime. 

#### 2.3.1.04 STPR04-SNL ATDM PMR Projects
Kokkos added support for NVIDIA Volta CPUs in preparation for the ORNL Summit  and LLNL Sierra machines coming online. The team also performed a 3-day training event at Cambridge University in the UK.

Released initial public version of DARMA on GitHub with Spack installation. Presented DARMA tutorial at ECP all-hands meeting. Tutorial with editable examples still live on GitHub pages.  Draft MPI-DARMA handoff interface completed in preparation for April demo of MPI/DARMA interoperability.


#### 2.3.1.12 STPM14-Runtime System for Application-Level Power Steering on Exascale Systems
WBS 2.3.1.12 Power Steering team improved the power model based on configuration exploration (with online monitoring) to support load imbalanced, non-deterministic applications, such as MiniFE, ParaDiS, and CoMD. Efforts to integrate manufacturing variation in this model are underway. Additionally, progress was made in understanding low-level interfaces such as Amester/OpenBMC for IBM systems. The team also worked on building Legion codes with MPI and to develop wrappers for non-MPI codes.

#### 2.3.1.13 STPM15-SOLLVE: Scaling OpenMP with LLVm for Exascale Performance and Portability
The project led an OpenMP meeting to standardize key features required by ECP applications (memory allocation, performance portability). The project has continued to collect ECP requirements and use cases.  There is rapid progress on a V&V suite for OpenMP, with focus on offload features.  LLVM compiler development is being continued with specific optimizations for ECP-related architectures and new OpenMP features.  The BOLT runtime is being enhanced and integrated with the LLVM OpenMP compiler.
