### 2.3.4 Data and Visualization

Spotlight: The SNL ATDM Data and Visualization Team modified the ParaView/Catalyst adaptor to support TuckerMPI compression, a parallel tensor-factorization-based method for compressing rectilinear data.  This integration, along with a demo using the miniFE mini-app, represents a significant step toward using TuckerMPI compression as a regular part of production visualization toolset. 
2.3.4.04 STDV04-SNL ATDM Data and Visualization Projects
2.3.4.04 STDV04-SNL ATDM Data and Visualization Projects: The team completed integration of the TuckerMPI compression library with ParaView/Catalyst.  They also improved parallel sorting performance for VTK-m on the Trinity ATS system. 

2.3.4.05 STDM07-VeloC: Very Low Overhead Transparent Multilevel Checkpoint/Restart
WBS 2.3.4.05 VeloC: Very Low Overhead Transparent Multilevel
Checkpoint/Restart project focused on defining, developing and
integrating the previously componentized modules to build the VeloC
backend software. They also focused on defining the communication
infrastructure that will exist between the various VeloC backend
processes. The team continued to work on the overall design with
continuous focus on application needs, implementation and testing
infrastructure of the VeloC software.

2.3.4.06 STDM08-Ez: Fast, Effective, Parallel Error-bounded Exascale Lossy Compression for Scientific Data
WBS 2.3.4.06 Ez: The EZ team implemented a block-based version for the openMP version. It gives a promising result on 3D data with high error bounds. The compression quality is degraded in some cases, requiring further investigation next month. SZ's executable now checks the validity of input. A paper on relative error bound is in the progress. The team also studied impact of decompressed data for NYX and HACC, by plotting the raw data vs. decompressed data at high resolution.

2.3.4.07 STDM09-UNIFYCR: A Checkpoint/Restart File System for Distributed Burst Buffers
WBS 2.3.4.07 STDM09-UNIFYCR: A Checkpoint/Restart File System for Distributed Burst Buffers.  During the ECP meeting, the Unify team met with candidate customers including ExaHDF5 and ACME to discuss requirements on Unify.  The team met with the Mercury and HXHIM teams to discuss Unify requirements on communication interfaces.  Development work on resource managers integration is underway and on track.  The team also began work to convert client/server communication from UNIX pipes to Mercury.

2.3.4.08 STDM10-ExaHDF5: Delivering Efficient Parallel I/O on Exascale Computing Systems
WBS 2.3.4.08 ExaHDF5: Delivering Efficient Parallel I/O on Exascale Computing Systems project made progress in developing the following features: 
Improved parallel I/O performance for metadata read operations for SWMR and creating a benchmark that shows the concurrency benefits of using SWMR. Design of data querying and VOL integration for release and testing of using node-local storage in Data Elevator are in progress. Working with QMCPACK team to improve I/O performance. 

2.3.4.09 STDM11-ADIOS Framework for Scientific Data on Exascale Systems
WBS 2.3.4.09 ADIOS project has been focusing on work towards the Q1/Y2 milestone, targeting a fusion code coupling run on Summitdev@OLCF using the new SST staging solution. They added the new ADIOS to the XGC fusion code, updated and extended the Fortran API based on this first-application experience. SST now works over Infiniband on generic clusters and the porting to Summitdev is ongoing. The team also have presented the first tutorial on the new ADIOS API at the 2018 ECP All-Hands-Meeting

2.3.4.11 STDM13-ZFP: Compressed Floating-Point Arrays
WBS 2.3.4.11 ZFP: Compressed Floating-Point Arrays project completed work on versioning to support persistent file I/O across multiple versions of ZFP.  They held discussions with the VTK-m team and have begun preliminary work to evaluate strategies for a CUDA-based ZFP array primitive for VTK-m.  The ZFP team also continued work on an HDF5 compatible ZFP-based format for CEED, an API to support OpenMP and CUDA compression, and support for n-D arrays and compressed array views.

2.3.4.12 STDA04-ALPINE: Algorithms and Infrastructure for In Situ Visualization and Analysis
LANL iteratively collaborates with Kitware to merge the FFT moments into the official vtk master branch. Further, we generate the vtkParallelMomentInvariants module. Based on the earlier prototype, it provides capability for the computation of moments in a distributed memory setting.

2.3.4.13 STDA05-ECP/VTK-m
The ECP/VTK-m project completed development work on filter operations for cross product and dot products on vectors. They also made progress on several color space functions to implement value to color mapping. Initial planning for the OpenMP backend (requested by the L2 after December's project review) took place. Maintenance in the form of bug fixes and production improvements continued to take place.
