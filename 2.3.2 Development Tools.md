### 2.3.2 Development Tools

#### 2.3.2.04 STDT04-SNL ATDM Development Tools Projects
WBS 2.3.2.04 STDT04-SNL ATDM Development Tools Projects: Performance analysis of ATDM codes on Trinity and Sierra early access HW is ongoing. Scalable build/integration/test framework is being prototyped. In addition, we are prototyping and LDMS-based continuous performance analysis capability on SNL testbeds which captures application performance data on a continuous basis for all jobs launched on the platform.

#### 2.3.2.05 STTO08-Exascale Code Generation Toolkit
Work was done on the tool interfaces for users, as part of the prep for the demo at the ECP all hands meeting.  This work improved the tool command line interface and has been released.  Additionally we have built a web page were one can input source code and get the immediate satisfaction of running several of the ROSE based ECP tools (for auto-parallelization (autopar), etc.), plus other tools. The location currently is on the AWS at: http://52.52.134.189/ and is still work in progress.


#### 2.3.2.06 STTO09-EXA-PAPI: The Exascale Performance Application Programming Interface
WBS 2.3.2.06 EXA-PAPI: The Exascale Performance Application Programming Interface project, together with the PEEKS team, explored the potential of software-defined events (SDE) for numerical Linear Algebra libraries. The idea is to provide the application scientists with easy access to library- and solver- specific metrics via the PAPI interface. This avoids cumbersome code instrumentation and library recompilation for debugging algorithm behavior or identifying performance bottlenecks.



#### 2.3.2.07 STTO10-Autotuning Compiler Technology for Cross-Architecture Transformation and Code Generation
WBS 2.3.2.07 Autotuning for Cross-Architecture Optimization: (1) We had a face-to-face planning meeting to discuss technology transfer of CHiLL autotuning compiler interfaces to the LLVM compiler infrastructure.  Our plan would also support autotuning of other Clang-level pragmas as well, including OpenMP and (in the future) OpenACC.  (2) We produced a side-by-side comparison of autotuning using SuRF vs. OpenTuner for SuperLU.  (3) We published a poster on the brick data layout at PPoPP 2018.   

#### 2.3.2.08 STTO11-Extending HPCToolkit to Measure and Analyze Code Performance on Exascale Platforms
WBS 2.3.2.08 The HPCToolkit project has deployed a new binary analyzer that improves the attribution of performance measurements for optimized code. The project team also developed new capabilities for measuring OpenACC and CUDA performance and is currently testing them in preparation for an upcoming milestone. As part of quality assurance testing in preparation for an upcoming release, the project team improved robustness of performance data collection during an application execution. 


#### 2.3.2.09 STTO12-PROTEAS: Programming Toolchain for Emerging Architectures and Systems
WBS 2.3.2.09 PROTEAS had strong representation at the ECP AHM, leading multiple breakout sessions on memory, LLVM, and other topics. They investigated data compression and encryption in PapyrusKV. They continued prototyping of CLACC, an OpenACC implementation in Clang/LLVM. They started the design of parallel reduction operation using Tapir LLVM extensions. They instrumented the Atlas LHC Python based code with TAU. They added support for FLANG compiler-based instrumentation in TAU.
