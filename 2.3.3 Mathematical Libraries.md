### 2.3.3 Mathematical Libraries

Spotlight: Maybe
The xSDK developers presented a tutorial at the ECP Annual Meeting entitled "Using DOE Math Libraries: Introducing the xSDK."  The tutorial explained collaboration toward two strategic objectives: building community and building sustainability, while emphasizing xSDK community policies that help improve code quality and compatibility across independently developed packages (currently hypre, MAGMA, MFEM, PETSc, SUNDIALS, SuperLU, Trilinos).

#### 2.3.3.01 STMS05-Extreme-scale Scientific xSDK for ECP
WBS 2.3.3.01 xSDK: Extreme-scale Scientific Software Development Kit for ECP:  The xSDK developers explained the first xSDK release for ECP through a poster and tutorial at the ECP Annual Meeting entitled "Using DOE Math Libraries: Introducing the xSDK."   The team also hosted informal breakout discussions led by the developers of current xSDK packages (hypre, MAGMA, MFEM, PETSc, SUNDIALS, SuperLU, Trilinos).  The team is collecting requirements for node-level interoperability between packages.

#### 2.3.3.04 STML04-SNL ATDM Math Libraries Projects
This Project has made progress along the following fronts: The Data Propagation Components sub-project is nearing completion of getting the Rapid Optimization Library (ROL) embedded in SPARC, which will support one of the L2 milestones; KokkosKernels has implemented a GPU version for SPARC kernels that has been tested on P100; Scalable Solvers is continuing to investigate a GPU-based apply phase for preconditioners; and Agile Components is nearing completion of the TEMPUS integration epic. 

#### 2.3.3.08 STMS09-ForTrilinos: Sustainable Production Fortran Interoperability with Trilinos Libraries
WBS 2.3.3.08 ForTrilinos: Sustainable Production Fortran Interoperability with Trilinos Libraries project completed documentation of the SWIG/Fortran implementation. A pull request to the main SWIG repository has been submitted, and the team is addressing the project's maintainers comments. The ForTrilinos interface to MPACT (through Futility) has been mostly completed, and is now in testing. The preliminary work to investigate Inversion of Control for linear solvers has been started.

SLATE offers a comprehensive set of C++ wrappers for BLAS and LAPACK. Any application, which is being developed in C++ and uses BLAS and/or LAPACK should be able to benefit from SLATE's wrappers. The code is available at https://bitbucket.org/icl/blaspp and https://bitbucket.org/icl/lapackpp. The white paper describing the effort is available at http://www.icl.utk.edu/publications/swan-002.

#### 2.3.3.09 STMS10-SLATE: Software for Linear Algebra Targeting Exascale
STMS 2.3.3.09 SLATE: The SLATE team finished a major overhaul of SLATE's class hierarchy for representing different types of matrices. Other task included: work on classes for exception handling, work on parallel BLAS, work on parallel norms, work on the testing infrastructure and unit tests, work on the CMake build system, work on a C++ API for batch BLAS.

Together with the ExaPAPI team, the PEEKS team explored the potential of software-defined events (SDE) for numerical LA libraries. The idea is to provide the application scientists with easy access to library- and solver- specific metrics via the PAPI interface. This avoids cumbersome code instrumentation and library recompilation for debugging algorithm behavior or identifying performance bottlenecks.

#### 2.3.3.11 STMS15-ALExa: Accelerated Libraries for Exascale
WBS 2.3.3.11 ALExa: DTK is nearing completion of first reactor calculation benchmark. The team met with several potential ECP stakeholders for a new N-dimensional search capability based on current DTK features. In collaboration with ExaStar, Tasmanian sparse grids approximation for a test dataset reduced memory footprint by order 1000 while preserving accuracy to over 88%; new directional limiting capability will enable the targeted 99% accuracy without significant increase in storage.
